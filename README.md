# Music Social Network Project

The Social Network website was a project assigned during a 3-month bootcamp at SPICED Academy.

This project is a **work in progress**.

## Overview

This Social Network is a fullstack single-page React app.

### My extension of the idea

I adapted the app for musicians, so users can look for other music lovers to create a band, make music together or simply share their passion.

### What can a user do?

 - Sign up
 - Say a little about themselves,
 - Become friends with other users,
 - Chat with them. 

## Built with

-   CSS
-   React
-   Redux
-   Socket.io
-   Webpack
-   PostgreSQL

## Getting Started
