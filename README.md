# Social Network Project

The Social Network website was a project assigned during a 3-month bootcamp at SPICED Academy.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS project.

## Overview

The Social Network is a fullstack project on which users can sign up, say a little about themselves, become friends with other users, and chat with them. This is a single-page application made with React.

I created a MUSIC SOCIAL NETWORK where users can look for other music lovers to create a band, make music together or simply share their passion.
